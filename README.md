What I learned
During this project, I reinforced my understanding of CSS layout techniques, particularly in utilizing Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive designs. I also enhanced my skills in creating hover and focus states for interactive elements, ensuring a smooth user experience.

##Continued development
In future projects, I aim to delve deeper into advanced CSS techniques and explore more complex layouts to further enhance my frontend development skills. Additionally, I plan to deepen my understanding of JavaScript frameworks like React and explore integrating backend technologies to create full-stack applications.

##Useful resources
MDN Web Docs - A comprehensive resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation. It helped me understand various CSS properties and their usage.
CSS-Tricks - An excellent website with articles, tutorials, and guides on CSS. I found their Flexbox and Grid guides particularly helpful in this project.
